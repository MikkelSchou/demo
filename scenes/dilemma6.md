 - Next: dilemma7

# Description
Lisa, your GMP coordinator, tells you that the quality of A3s in your team varies drastically, and she thinks it might be because of lack of competencies. 
To improve the overall quality of A3s, Lisa suggests making the two most skilled team members responsible for driving all future A3 activities. Lisa volunteers to lead this initiative.

How do you respond?


# Choice
I thank Lisa for making this suggestion and for taking the initiative to improve the quality of our A3s. I encourage her to approach the problem more systematically before she decides on a solution so she makes sure she addresses the root cause of the low quality A3s.

# Variables

 

# Feedback
Great choice.Your support of Lisa's initiative is very empowering and it's great that you encourage her to solve the problem to root cause in a systematic way. You might also consider coaching her through the problem solving. 
This is a dilemma about accelerating team members development, empower others to take action and building a culture where problems are eliminated at root cause.




# Choice
I thank Lisa for the suggestion and initiative. I tell her that it's important to identify the root cause of the problem, so I will take a look at the A3s myself and get back to her when I've identified the best solution.

# Variables


# Feedback
It's great that you want to explore the issue of low-quality A3s in more detail yourself. However, to further develop Lisa you might want to consider ways to engage her in the entire process, e.g. by involving her more in your own diagnosis of the problem. 
This is a dilemma about accelerating team members development, empower others to take action and building a culture where problems are eliminated at root cause.





# Choice
I thank Lisa for the suggestion but tell her that I'm not sure this solution addresses the root cause of the problem. I therefore propose that we meet to discuss the variation in the quality of the team's A3s more systematically and lay out the options for different solutions before we make a final descision.

# Variables


# Feedback
Good choice. You are right to suggest a systematic problem solving before committing to a particular solution, and it's great that you're inviting Lisa to be a part of this. As an AM, it's important to be able to coach and delegate work to your employees.

# Choice
I thank Lisa for raising this issue but tell her that I'm concerned about narrowing down A3 competencies to only two employees as this could limit the rest of the team's development. Instead, I let her know that I'll take an action sticker to the AM performance board with a suggestion of a team-wide A3 re-training. 

# Variables



# Feedback
Your focus on developing your team's capabilities in the long term is great. However, you should consider doing a systematic problem solving before suggesting to do a team-wide re-training. Perhaps the issue of low quality A3s is not due to lack of competencies and your training efforts would then be a waste.
