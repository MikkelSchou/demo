# Description
In the following you will meet a series of leadership dilemmas. For each dilemma you must choose between 3-4 options. 

In case a dilemma is not directly referable to your team or department, we encourage you to compare it to a similar situation and base the answer on your reflections.

You will get feedback on your choices when you have completed all dilemmas.

Note that your results will be saved if you are not able to complete the dilemmas in one session.
