# Description
You are leading a team that works in a controlled, not classified (CNC) area. This means that there is a standard which specifies how to gown.

Over the past week you've overheard some colleagues discuss that the procedure for gowning is not being followed. You don't know if it goes for your team.

What do you do?  


# Choice
I revisit the gowning standard (SOP) together with one of my team members, to make sure I understand the procedure myself. Afterwards, I let the team know that I will process confirm the SOP and then I take time to observe the gowning behaviours of my employees a number of times before I decide on what actions to take. 

# Variables



# Feedback

This is a great choice. It underlines your thorough understanding of process confirmation and the value of to going to where the problem may be to gather and process data first. It's great that you don't jump to conclusions when you hear of the possible non-compliance with standards in your team. 
This is a dilemma between taking the time to go out to see and understand how working processes are performing, building trust and ensuring an enganging working environment




# Choice
I make sure to send an email to my team that same day to let them know that I will be process confirming the gowning SOP because it is not being followed. I then go to the changing area a few Mondays in a row to observe the gowning behaviours. If I observe anyone who doesn't follow the standard, I let them know on the spot and advise them what they need to do differently.

# Variables



# Feedback
It's great that you're responding so quickly to the news of possible non-compliance with standards in your team. However, be careful not to jump to conclusions maybe it wasn't your team members the colleagues were referring to. Letting your team know that you will be observing them in advance is the right thing to do. If you observe non-compliant behaviour, it's important you decide on more sustainable actions than just addressing the individual employee - it could be, that your entire team needs to be retrained or maybe it's not the quality of the SOP that is the root cause if you discover non-compliant behaviour.

# Choice
I schedule a meeting with Louise, a trusted employee, to find out if there are any problems with following the gowning standard (SOP) in the team before I decide what actions to take.

# Variables



# Feedback
It's a good idea to explore the issue in more detail instead of immediatly assum that your team members are not following the gowning standard. However, it's best to go out and openly process confirm if in fact the SOP is being followed or not instead of only talking to one team member.
