# Description
You are leading a team that works in a classified not controlled (CNC) area. This means that there is a standard which specifies how to gown.

Over the past week you've overheard some colleagues discuss that the standard for gowning is not being followed.

What do you do?  

# Choice
 I revisit the gowning standard (SOP) to make sure I understand the procedure myself. Afterwards I take time to observe the gowning behaviours of my employees before I decide what actions to take. 

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -1
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback

This is a great choice which underlines your understanding of process confirmation. You may also consider involving your team to discuss if and how the gowning standard could be improved. This is a dilemma between making decisions, process confirming and eliminating root causes.  

# Outcome

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Lilly's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Lilly to accept (-1 on strategic) 


# Choice
I send an email to my team to inform them that I will Process Confirm the gowning SOP. I then go to the changing area on Monday to observe if the standard is being followed or not. When I observe anyone who doesn't follow the standard, I let them know on the spot and tell them what they need to do differently.

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -1
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
It's great that you're responding so quickly to the news of possible non-compliance with standards in your team. Letting your team know that you will be observing them in advance is the right thing to do. When you observe non-compliant behaviour it's important you deside on more sustainable actions than just addressing the individual employee - maybe the SOP needs to be updated or the employees need to be retrained. This is a dilemma between making decisions, process confirming and eliminating root causes.

# Outcome

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Jonas's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Jonas to accept (-1 on strategic) 



# Choice
I schedule a meeting with Louise, a trusted employee, to find out if there are any problems with the standard for changing clothes in the team.

# Variables
 - strategic: +0
 - accountability: +0
 - ambiguity: -4
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
It's a good idea to explore the issue in more detail before you assume that there is a problem with the gowning standard. However, it's best to engage your full team in an open-ended discussion where you ask for everyone's input on how to improve the gowning standard as opposed to only talking to one team member. This is a dilemma between making decisions, process confirming and solving problems to root cause.



# Outcome

You experienced a negative effect in output (-4). No effect on neither engagement nor resource spend.
