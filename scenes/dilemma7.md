# Description
Jens is a very experienced technician on your team. He works with the maintenance of production equipment and has been on your team for many years.

He tells you that one of the pumps occasionally crashes, which is very costly, as it puts a temporary hold to the production. The pump typically crashes when it's been operating for too long because the impeller blades break. Jens suggests more frequent replacement of the blades to avoid downtime.

You know that Jens has a very busy schedule, and you are concerned that assigning him more work to replace the blades could lead to delays in his scheduled maintenance work, which would also be costly. 

How do you respond?

# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and initiative to reduce system breakdowns. I ask him to update the maintenance plan for the pump and increase the frequency of impeller blade replacements so we can implement his suggestion as fast as possible.  

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -1
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback

It's great that you're supportive of Jens' suggestion. Being able to identify and implement process improvements is core to the Novo Nordisk Way. However, you should make sure that the implementation of the new maintenance schedule is planned in a way that doesn't interfere with the current schedule. By giving Jens more work, there is a risk that some of his other maintenance tasks get delayed, which also could lead to expensive downtime. This is a dilemma between managing cost, quality and delivery.

# Outcome

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Lilly's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Lilly to accept (-1 on strategic) 


# Choice
I thank Jens for this suggestion. However, I but tell him that he has too long been too busy finding a sustainable solution that he's currently too busy managing the daily maintenance of the production equipment to also implement the new impeller blade replacement system. First we need to define, which of his tasks that can be delegated to others, and until then his time is better spent managing daily maintenance and then fixing the occasional pump replacements when they do occur. 

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -1
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
Being able to identify and implement process improvements is core to the Novo Nordisk Way. Therefore it's great you might consider delegation as a er ways to make Jens' suggestion work. It may take more time and planning, but if it could lead to a more stable production where Jens is not a bottleneck and fewer breakdowns in the long run it's always worth looking into. This is a dilemma between managing cost, quality and delivery. 

# Outcome

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Jonas's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Jonas to accept (-1 on strategic) 



# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and encourage him to implement the idea. However, before implementing the new maintenance schedule, I ask him to take the needed time to plan the replacements carefully so they don't interefere with his regular maintenance work. Once we have a good plan in place, we can initiate the new schedule.

# Variables
 - strategic: +0
 - accountability: +0
 - ambiguity: -4
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
 This is a great response. Being able to identify and implement process improvements is core to the Novo Nordisk Way. With this choice, you are delaying the new process improvement. However, your focus on planning also ensures that the new process is properly integrated into Jens' current maintenance schedule. This, in turn, will reduce unnecessary disruptions to his regular maintenance work. This is a dilemma between managing cost, quality and delivery. overvej delegation lige om lidt st√•r deu i smame situation igen legation


# Outcome

You experienced a negative effect in output (-4). No effect on neither engagement nor resource spend.
